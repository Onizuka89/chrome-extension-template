This is meant to be used as a template for me to more easily get started when I want to make a chrome extension with a popup.
If there are any great flaws with it feel free to point this out in the issues.

As for why jQuery is included, it is used to show a way to add other libraries into the context of the content.js file.
Other libraries could have been used, but jQuery is something I like to use, and it is something people recognize,
so hopefully makes it clear it is to import libaries, and not just a kind of way to separate the code into more files for other reasons.
